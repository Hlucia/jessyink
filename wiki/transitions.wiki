= Introduction =

Currently, there are three different slide transitions available in JessyInk: appear, fade and pop.

= Details =

Using the JessyInk "transition" extension, the transitions for the slides can be set by supplying the name of the layer in the dialog window and selecting the transition type. Different transition types for transitioning in and out can be specified. Furthermore, the duration in seconds of the transition can be specified by setting the corresponding number to a value between 0.1 and 10.0. Please note that the duration has no effect on the transition type "appear", as this transition is instantaneous.

Pressing "apply" saves the changes. The default is for the slides to simply "appear". If transition are specified with a master slide, these transitions will be used as the default transitions.
