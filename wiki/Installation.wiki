= Introduction =

Due to the new JessyInk extensions for Inkscape, installation is now (semi-)automatic and very straight forward.

=== 1) Installing the JessyInk extensions ===

The JessyInk extensions depend on the "inkex" script provided by Inkscape. Therefore, the easiest way to install them is to simply copy all the files found in the folder named "inkscapeExtensions" from the distribution to the directory containing the "inkex.py" file. Depending on your operating system, this file is usually located in one of the following directories:

  * on Windows (English localisation): "C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\extensions"
  * on Linux: "/usr/share/inkscape/entensions"
  * on OS X: "/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/extensions"

Having copied the files to the correct location, Inkscape will automatically display the submenu "JessyInk" in the "effects" menu. The submenu will contain entries for all the different JessyInk extensions.

Should you want to install the JessyInk extensions in a different location or should you experience problems running the extensions, please verify that one of the paths given at beginning of the Python script of each JessyInk extension points to the directory where the "inkex.py" script is located.

=== 2) Installing the JessyInk script ===

After the JessyInk extension has been installed, a new sub-menu titled "JessyInk" is available in the effects menu. Selecting "install/update" in this menu opens an effect window. Pressing "apply" in this window, installs (or updates) the JessyInk script. Unless you inspect the document in the XML editor, you won't notice any change.

=== 3) Adding the "onload" attribute to the root node ===

Due to the way Inkscape interacts with extensions, it is currently not possible to have an extension change the attributes of the root node. Hence, this step is still manual. The final step is . To allow the JessyInk script to do its magic when the file is loaded into the browser, it is necessary to add an "onload" attribute to the root node ("svg:svg"). After opening the Inkscape XML editor, the root node ("svg:svg") is selected (1 in Figure 1). Then the attribute name ("onload") and value ("jessyInkInit()") are set (2 in Figure 1). Using the "set" button (3 in Figure 1), the new attribute can be saved and should appear in the list of attributes (4 in Figure 1).
