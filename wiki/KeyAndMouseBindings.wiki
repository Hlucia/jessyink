= Introduction =

One of the goals for version 1.3 is to introduce custom key bindings. The idea is to define a set of "actions" (which correspond to functions or sequences of functions in the JessyInk script) and allow the user to bind them to specific keys. The summary below is intended to provide an overview of the current key bindings. These can than be consolidated into "actions". The main purpose of this page is the use for development.
